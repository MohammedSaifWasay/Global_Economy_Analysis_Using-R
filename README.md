# 🌍 Global Economy Analysis

## 📊 Introduction and Abstract

This project analyzes a comprehensive global economy dataset, encompassing economic indicators from various countries over several decades. The focus lies in uncovering patterns and correlations among variables such as:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Exchange rates
- Population
- Government expenditure
- Imports and exports

Special attention is given to economies like **China** and **India**, which serve as case studies to understand broader economic trends.

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

- 📈 How has GDP evolved for China and India?
- 💱 Is there a relationship between exchange rates and GDP (India)?
- 👥 How does population size affect per capita GNI?
- 📦 What impact do imports and exports have on GDP?
- 🏛️ How is government expenditure linked to GDP growth?

## 🔍 Analytical Methods

- **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Correlation Analysis**
- **Scatter Plots & Line Charts**
- **Regression Models**
- **Time Series Analysis (Proposed)**

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. **GDP Trends (1970–2021)**
- **China**: Grew from $256B to $16.86T — rapid industrial growth.
- **India**: Increased from $252B to $3.17T — steady rise with dips in early 1990s.

### 2. **Exchange Rate vs GDP (India)**
- Correlation: **0.12** (weak positive)
- Insight: GDP appears less influenced by currency fluctuations and more by production/trade.

### 3. **Population vs Per Capita GNI**
- Correlation: **-0.18** (weak negative)
- Insight: Countries with lower population (e.g., Luxembourg) show higher per capita income.

### 4. **Exports and Imports vs GDP**
- **Exports**: Strong correlation (**0.72**)
- **Imports**: Moderate correlation (**0.54**)
- Conclusion: Export-led growth is a key driver in emerging economies.

### 5. **Government Spending vs GDP**
- Correlation: **0.64**
- Insight: Public spending positively influences GDP, especially in infrastructure-heavy economies.

### 6. **GDP Growth Rates**
- **Top Performers**: China (9–10%), Vietnam (>7%)
- **Low Performers**: Venezuela, Zimbabwe (negative growth)

### 7. **Population Size vs Total GDP**
- Correlation: **0.68** (moderate positive)
- Larger populations often lead to higher GDPs — though not necessarily higher GDP per capita.

## 🧪 Proposed Advanced Analysis

To enhance insights:

- 🔁 **Multivariate Regression** to determine GDP drivers
- 📉 **Time Series Forecasting** (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
- 🧬 **Clustering** to group similar economies
- 🧠 **Hypothesis Testing** (e.g., impact of public spending on GDP)

---

## 📌 Conclusion

- **Exports** and **government spending** are major contributors to GDP.
- **Exchange rate** has limited influence on India's GDP.
- **High population** may reduce per capita income, emphasizing the need for productivity.

Future work will apply advanced models to strengthen policy recommendations and better understand global economic dynamics.
